# Cell-Type-Specific-Graphs
PrePR-CT is a simple graph-based deep learning method designed to predict the transcriptional responses to chemical perturbations in single-cell data. This method utilizes Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to encode cell-type graphs from batches of training samples. It then integrates these encoded graphs with control gene expression data and pre-defined perturbation embeddings. The combined data is processed through Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to predict gene expression responses accurately. The preprint is available in:
